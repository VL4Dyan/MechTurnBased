# MechTurnBased

Unreal Engine c++/blueprint gamedev project.

Goal: a game of mecha genre with a turnbased combat system.

Currently my objective is to create a foundation for combat system. And right now were implemented: grid, combat unit, combat unit components and buildings creation systems, simple UI for player interactions, some camera controls. My next step is to make action confirmations (data updates along with visual representation of an executed move).
